# Introduction to Webcanter

 - See example for inspiration
   [great documentation](http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/what-to-write/)

So far, this tutorial follows the
[tutorial from data-sorcery.org](http://data-sorcery.org/2009/11/29/incanter-webapp/).

The changes include updating it for the current version of Compojure,
Hiccup and Ring.

Next step would be playing with it via REPL.
